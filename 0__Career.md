# PIE

		key elements of Performance, Image and Exposure (a.k.a. PIE):
		a. Performance:  this is about the day-to-day work you’re tasked with and the quality of the results you deliver.
		b. Image: this is what other people think of you.  Your personal brand.  
			i. Do you maintain a positive attitude? 
			ii. Do you lead with solutions to issues, 
			iii. or are you the person that solely offers roadblocks when others suggest changes or alternatives?
		c. Exposure:  
			i. Who knows about you and what you do?  
			ii. Does your boss know what you do?  
			iii. Does their boss know you and what you do?  
			iv. Do others inside and outside your organization know anything about you?

# The RACI model 
The RACI model is a straightforward tool used for identifying roles and responsibilities and avoiding confusion over those roles and responsibilities during a project. The acronym RACI stands for:

Responsible: The person who does the work to achieve the task. They have responsibility for getting the work done or decision made. As a rule this is one person; examples might be a business analyst, application developer or technical architect.
Accountable: The person who is accountable for the correct and thorough completion of the task. This must be one person and is often the project executive or project sponsor. This is the role that responsible is accountable to and approves their work.
Consulted: The people who provide information for the project and with whom there is two-way communication. This is usually several people, often subject matter experts.
Informed: The people kept informed of progress and with whom there is one-way communication. These are people that are affected by the outcome of the tasks, so need to be kept up-to-date.
