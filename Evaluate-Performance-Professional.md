# Professional
*  make others think of you as reliable, respectful, and competent. 

1. Competence. You’re good at what you do – and you have the skills and knowledge that enable you to do your job well.

2. Reliability. People can depend on you to show up on time, submit your work when it’s supposed to be ready, etc.

3. Honesty. You tell the truth and are upfront about where things stand.

4. Integrity. You are known for your consistent principles.

5. Respect For Others. Treating all people as if they mattered is part of your approach.

6. Self-Upgrading. Rather than letting your skills or knowledge become outdated, you seek out ways of staying current.

7. Being Positive. No one likes a constant pessimist. Having an upbeat attitude and trying to be a problem-solver makes a big difference.

8. Supporting Others. You share the spotlight with colleagues, take time to show others how to do things properly, and lend an ear when necessary.

9. **Staying Work-Focused**. Not letting your private life needlessly have an impact on your job, and not spending time at work attending to personal matters.

10. **Listening Carefully**. People want to be heard, so you give people a chance to explain their ideas properly.


**Treat your boss like a possible mentor. **
If your boss sees potential in you as an employee, they may try to act as a mentor to you. It’s important to maintain a relationship with your boss that is professional and humble. Avoid acting like you know more about the job than your boss does or that you are not willing to learn new skills or to take their advice.[11]
Having a mentor as your boss can lead to bigger career opportunities and the ability to expand your existing skill set.
