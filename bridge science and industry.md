# support industry scientists.



### 1) How can GSA best engage with and support industry scientists? E.g. conferences, journals, recruitment, and existing programs

* special section during GSA meeting about topic such as **Application genomics**

* Have more folks from industry participate in GSA meetings and provide presentations/posters. Professors need to know the needs from the industry, and industry’s concern about open source, and regulatory framework.

* maybe lower the membership fees and registration fees for non-academia members. Industry also cares about conference cost!

* Have special issues or sections in Genetics and G3 talking about Genetics/Genomics in industry. 

* Guidance for graduate and undergraduate students on how to pursuit career in industry after there academia research training. Provide opportunities for them to interact with related industries during GSA conferences, NOT just through booths in product show.  


### 2) Are there new and novel ways these interactions could take place?

* on-line discussion (such as YouTube)

* Twitter account twitting NEWS and DISCUSSION about **bridging Genetics and Application in Industry**

* Accelerate local interactions between industries and research organizations by hosting symposium. 


### 3) How can GSA strengthen ties with industry scientists?

Some gaps to fill between Academia Genetics/Genomics and industry:

* Not all research fields are equally important and interesting to the industry from the applicable preservative. Identify those valuable fields is the first step. 
* Applied research is the bridge between basic research and industry. Not all the protocol and software tools  published by academia researchers are readily applicable under industry setting. While the over-emphasize on innovation in academia during publication and funding application has non-negligible negative impact on tool polishing and improvements, scientists in the industry have to either spend significant amount of time to polish these tools (not a good thing for prfit driven entity), or limited by the number of applicable tools. GSA can encourage scientists from both side to work on those gaps from the publication and community side. 
* A few hot area from my perspective that worth more attention: High-throughput phenotype, Genome editing and genome design, Precision breeding, Deep learning in Genomics, and Approaches to integrate -omincs data to understand genotype~phenotype.

```Another potential challenge concerns the role of intellectual property rights (IPR). As academia is typically centred on open-source research papers, there is potentially a conflict between raw science and possible commercial advantage.```



`Nixon also suggests a shift among the academic community: “I think that a lot of what universities are trying to do at the moment is to change the stage at which they are doing their research. Academics are being encouraged to work with companies more than perhaps they did in the past, and funding is available to work more commercially, so this has led to a focus on pre-commercialisation work.”`



`Crowd-sourced funding platforms such as [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) have allowed numerous start-ups access to potential funding to bridge the gap to commercial reality. `
